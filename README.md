# village_simulator
Agent-based simulation of a self-sufficient village

This is a Unity 3D project.

CS3010 - Code submission by Cameron Courtman-Stock.

Scripts/code can be accessed at: village_simulator/Assets/Scripts.

 - Assets - The Assets folder is the main folder that contains the Assets used by a Unity project. The contents of the Project window in the Editor correspond directly to the contents of the Assets folder. Most API functions assume that everything is located in the Assets folder, and so donâ€™t require it to be mentioned explicitly. However, some functions do need to have the Assets folder included as part of a pathname (for example, certain functions in the AssetDatabase class).
